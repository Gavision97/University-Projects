The next project - c_hw2 - contains few files:
1. Jerry.h - all of the structes - Jerry, PLanet, Origin & PhysicalCharacteristic- sitting there there,
also of the function declaration that going to be implemented at Jerry.c

2. Jerry.c - ulitilization of the function that declared at Jerry.h. Each function returns somethins else, some return pointer to structures, while others return boolean answer or status (success/failure). The file contain also few static funcion for helping other function in the file.

3. ManageJerries.c - That file contain the application of the program and used for the user that going to use the program. The file contain lots of helping function to the program and all of the cases that the user can use in the main.

4. Defs.h - header file that contain the declarion of two enum typedefs; one is the bool and the second is status.

For the tester of the project : the project contain lots of explanations where i think there are need for some, and use of the typefs that had been declared at the file Defs.h
